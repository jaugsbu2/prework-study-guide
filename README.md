# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is to buiild a prework study guide for the bootcamp course. The prework study guide is a training mechanism which showed new developers how HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript all work together in a single project. The contents of the webpage show notes taken by myself about each of these subjects and if the viewer opens the console in google webdevelopment tools then they will see each subject as well as a random output suggesting which topic to study first.
